# Virtual Receptionist Flow Fix Summary

## Problem Statement
The face detection was not working properly because it was starting automatically without proper employee/visitor classification. The bot needed to ask users if they are employees or visitors first, and only trigger face recognition for employees.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Agent Prompts (`backend/src/prompts.py`)
- **Changed**: Modified the greeting flow to emphasize the correct sequence
- **New Flow**: 
  1. Wake word detection: "Hey Clara" activates the system
  2. Immediately ask: "Hello! Are you an Employee or a Visitor?"
  3. ONLY if user says "employee" → trigger face recognition
  4. If user says "visitor" → proceed with visitor information collection
  5. Face recognition should NEVER start automatically - only after employee classification

### 2. Updated Agent Instructions (`backend/src/agent.py`)
- **Changed**: Enhanced Clara's instructions to enforce strict flow sequence
- **Key Points**:
  - MANDATORY Classification: IMMEDIATELY ask "Hello! Are you an Employee or a Visitor?"
  - Face recognition is triggered ONLY after employee classification
  - Added warning: "NEVER start face recognition automatically"

### 3. Enhanced Flow Manager (`backend/src/flow_manager.py`)
- **Changed**: Added signal posting when employee is classified
- **New Feature**: When user is classified as employee, the system now posts a signal to the frontend to start face capture
- **Code Added**:
  ```python
  # Signal frontend to start face capture - ONLY NOW after employee classification
  from flow_signal import post_signal
  post_signal("start_face_capture", {
      "message": "Employee verified - starting face recognition",
      "next_endpoint": "/flow/face_recognition"
  })
  ```

### 4. Updated Frontend VideoCapture Component (`frontend/components/VideoCapture.tsx`)
- **Changed**: Made face scanning conditional based on backend signals
- **New Behavior**: 
  - Initially shows "Waiting for employee classification..."
  - Polls backend for signals every 2 seconds
  - Only starts face scanning when "start_face_capture" signal is received
  - Prevents automatic face scanning for visitors

### 5. Added Signal Endpoint (`backend/src/server.py`)
- **New Endpoint**: `/get_signal` - Allows frontend to check for signals from backend
- **Functionality**: 
  - Returns current signal and clears it
  - Enables communication between flow manager and frontend
  - Supports conditional face recognition triggering

## New Flow Sequence

### For Employees:
1. User says "Hey Clara"
2. Clara responds:"Hello, my name is clara, the receptionist at an Info Services, How may I help you today?"
3. User says "Hello Clara"
3. Clara responds: "Hello! Are you an Employee or a Visitor?"
5. User says "I am an employee"
6. Backend signals frontend to start face capture
7. Face recognition begins
8. If successful: Welcome message + full access
9. If failed: Manual verification with name/ID/OTP
10. Data passed to LiveKit for TTS response

### For Visitors:
1. User says "Hey Clara"
2. Clara responds: "Hello! Are you an Employee or a Visitor?"
3. User says "I am a visitor"
4. Clara asks for visitor information (no face recognition)
5. Visitor info collection process begins
6. Host notification and visitor logging
7. Data passed to LiveKit for TTS response

## Testing
- Created comprehensive test script (`test_new_flow.py`)
- All tests pass successfully:
  ✅ Wake word detection works
  ✅ Employee/visitor classification works
  ✅ Face recognition only triggers after employee classification
  ✅ Visitors don't trigger face recognition
  ✅ Data flows correctly through the system
  ✅ Ready for LiveKit/TTS integration

## Files Modified
1. `backend/src/prompts.py` - Updated greeting flow instructions
2. `backend/src/agent.py` - Enhanced agent instructions for strict flow
3. `backend/src/flow_manager.py` - Added signal posting for face capture
4. `frontend/components/VideoCapture.tsx` - Made face scanning conditional
5. `backend/src/server.py` - Added `/get_signal` endpoint

## Files Created
1. `test_new_flow.py` - Comprehensive test script for the new flow
2. `FLOW_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Key Benefits
1. **Fixed Face Detection Issue**: Face recognition now works properly with proper user classification
2. **Improved User Experience**: Clear conversation flow with proper prompts
3. **Security Enhancement**: Face recognition only triggers for employees
4. **Better Resource Management**: No unnecessary face scanning for visitors
5. **Maintainable Architecture**: Clear separation between employee and visitor flows
6. **LiveKit Integration Ready**: All data flows correctly through the system for TTS responses

## Usage
The system now follows the exact sequence you requested:
1. Bot asks "Are you an employee or visitor?"
2. If employee → start face recognition and verify
3. If visitor → collect visitor information
4. All responses are passed to LiveKit for TTS output

The face detection issue has been completely resolved, and the system now works as intended with proper conversation flow management.
